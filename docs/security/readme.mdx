# 01 - Security (Security-First Mindset)

**Problem this solves:** Most developers add security as an afterthought, leading to vulnerabilities that are expensive to fix later.

**What happens if you get this wrong:** Data breaches, user trust loss, legal liability, and potentially business-ending security incidents.

## ðŸš¨ Why Security First?

Security isn't a feature you add later - it's a foundation you build on. This section teaches you to think like an attacker so you can defend like a professional.

## Files in This Section

### ðŸ”¥ High-Priority (Start Here)
- `row-level-security-explained.md` - **THE #1 PAIN POINT** - RLS deep dive with examples
- `environment-variables-security.md` - .env best practices, what to NEVER commit
- `common-security-mistakes.md` - What beginners do wrong (and how to fix it)

### Core Security Files
- `README.md` - Why security matters from day 1 (you are here)
- `authentication-security.md` - Auth best practices, JWT security
- `api-security-checklist.md` - Rate limiting, input validation, CORS
- `deployment-security.md` - Production security checklist

## Learning Path

1. **Start Here**: `row-level-security-explained.md` - Master the biggest challenge
2. **Secure Your Secrets**: `environment-variables-security.md` - Protect sensitive data
3. **Auth Security**: `authentication-security.md` - Secure user flows
4. **API Protection**: `api-security-checklist.md` - Defend your endpoints
5. **Production Ready**: `deployment-security.md` - Go live safely
6. **Avoid Pitfalls**: `common-security-mistakes.md` - Learn from others' mistakes

## Security Mindset Principles

- **Assume Breach**: Plan for when (not if) something goes wrong
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security
- **Least Privilege**: Give minimum access needed
- **Fail Secure**: When something breaks, fail to a secure state
- **Validate Everything**: Never trust user input

## Quick Security Checklist

### Before You Code
- [ ] Environment variables properly configured
- [ ] Database RLS policies planned
- [ ] Authentication flow mapped out

### Before You Deploy
- [ ] All tables have RLS enabled
- [ ] Input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented
- [ ] Secrets audit completed

## Success Criteria

After completing this section, you should:
- Understand Row Level Security and implement it correctly
- Know how to handle environment variables securely
- Have a security-first mindset when building features
- Be able to identify and fix common security vulnerabilities
