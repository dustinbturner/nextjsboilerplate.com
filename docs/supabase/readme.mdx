# 03 - Supabase Integration

**Problem this solves:** Supabase is powerful but complex - developers struggle with RLS policies, client setup, and understanding when to use server vs client connections.

**What happens if you get this wrong:** Security vulnerabilities, performance issues, auth failures, and data access problems.

## 🎯 Integration Philosophy

Supabase isn't just a database - it's your entire backend. This section teaches you to leverage its full power safely and efficiently.

8. **Debugging**: `troubleshooting-supabase.md` - Fix common issues

## Key Integration Principles

### Security-First Design
- **RLS Everywhere**: Every table gets policies before production
- **Least Privilege**: Users only see/modify their own data
- **Server-Side Validation**: Never trust client-side checks alone

### Client Strategy
- **Server Client**: For server components and API routes
- **Browser Client**: For client components only
- **Service Role**: For admin operations and migrations only

### Performance Patterns
- **Fetch Close to Use**: Get data where you need it
- **Batch Operations**: Minimize round trips
- **Real-time Sparingly**: Only for truly live features
