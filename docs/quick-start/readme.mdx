# 00 - Quick Start & Setup

**Problem this solves:** Getting developers productive quickly without overwhelming them with complexity.

**What happens if you get this wrong:** Developers get stuck in setup hell, abandon the project, or make security mistakes from day one.

## Teaching Philosophy

This section follows a "learning by doing" approach - you'll build something simple that works, then understand why it works.

## Files in This Section

### Core Setup Files
- `how-to-setup-project.md` - Step-by-step project setup with explanations
- `how-to-connect-supabase.md` - Supabase project connection guide
- `environment-variables-explained.md` - What they are, why we need them, security implications
- `understanding-the-file-structure.md` - Tour of folders & why they exist
- `your-first-feature.md` - Build something simple to understand the flow
- `troubleshooting-setup.md` - Common setup issues & fixes

## Learning Path

1. **Start Here**: `how-to-setup-project.md` - Get everything running
2. **Connect Backend**: `how-to-connect-supabase.md` - Database & auth setup
3. **Understand Structure**: `understanding-the-file-structure.md` - Know where things go
4. **Build Something**: `your-first-feature.md` - Hands-on learning
5. **When Stuck**: `troubleshooting-setup.md` - Common issues

## Key Principles

- **Security from Day 1**: Environment variables are explained with security context
- **Problem-First**: Each step explains what problem it solves
- **Real Examples**: Working code you can copy and understand
- **Troubleshooting Focus**: Anticipate and solve common issues

## Success Criteria

After completing this section, you should:
- Have a working Next.js app with Supabase
- Understand the project structure and why it's organized this way
- Know how to add a simple feature with authentication
- Feel confident troubleshooting common setup issues
