# Prompt Templates

## What Problem Does This Solve?

Writing effective prompts for AI coding assistants is a skill that dramatically impacts the quality of suggestions you receive. These templates provide proven patterns for common development tasks.

## What Happens If You Get This Wrong?

- **Vague responses** that don't address your specific needs
- **Generic code** that doesn't match your project patterns
- **Missing context** leading to incorrect assumptions
- **Wasted time** iterating to get useful suggestions

## Advanced Prompt Techniques

### Chain of Thought Prompting
```
Let's work through implementing [FEATURE] step by step:

Step 1: First, let's design the data model
- What tables do we need?
- What are the relationships?
- What RLS policies are required?

Step 2: Then, let's plan the component structure
- Which components should be Server Components?
- Where do we need Client Components?
- How will data flow between them?

Step 3: Finally, let's implement the user interface
- What's the user flow?
- How do we handle loading and error states?
- What validation is needed?

Please work through each step with me.
```

### Role-Based Prompting
```
Act as a senior NextJS developer reviewing my implementation.

Focus on:
- NextJS 15 App Router best practices
- Security considerations with Supabase
- Performance optimization
- Code maintainability

[Your specific request and code]
```

### Constraint-Based Prompting
```
Given these constraints:
- Must use Server Components where possible
- Must implement proper RLS
- Must handle all error cases
- Must be accessible (WCAG 2.1)
- Must work on mobile devices

How would you implement [FEATURE]?
```
