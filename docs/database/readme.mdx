# 04 - Database & Drizzle ORM

**Problem this solves:** Database design and ORM usage patterns that scale and perform well while maintaining security.

**What happens if you get this wrong:** Poor performance, security vulnerabilities, migration nightmares, and technical debt that's expensive to fix.

## 🗄️ Database Philosophy

Your database is the foundation of your application. This section teaches you to design schemas that are secure, performant, and maintainable from day one.

## Files in This Section

### Core Database Files
- `README.md` - Why Drizzle over Prisma & database philosophy (you are here)
- `schema-design-principles.md` - Good database design with security in mind
- `migrations-and-schema-changes.md` - Managing schema evolution safely
- `writing-good-queries.md` - Query patterns & performance optimization
- `relationships-and-joins.md` - Handling foreign keys & relations properly
- `indexing-and-performance.md` - Database optimization strategies
- `seed-data-and-testing.md` - Development data setup and testing patterns

## Learning Path

1. **Design Foundation**: `schema-design-principles.md` - Learn to design secure, scalable schemas
2. **ORM Mastery**: `writing-good-queries.md` - Write efficient Drizzle queries
3. **Relationships**: `relationships-and-joins.md` - Handle complex data relationships
4. **Evolution**: `migrations-and-schema-changes.md` - Manage schema changes safely
5. **Performance**: `indexing-and-performance.md` - Optimize for speed and scale
6. **Development**: `seed-data-and-testing.md` - Set up development workflows

## Why Drizzle Over Prisma?

### Drizzle Advantages
- **Type Safety**: Better TypeScript integration
- **Performance**: Closer to SQL, less overhead
- **Flexibility**: More control over queries
- **Bundle Size**: Smaller runtime footprint
- **SQL-First**: Easier to optimize and debug

### When You Might Choose Prisma
- Team prefers more abstraction
- Heavy use of complex relations
- Need advanced introspection features

## Key Database Principles

### Security-First Design
- **RLS by Default**: Every table gets Row Level Security
- **Least Privilege**: Users only access their own data
- **Input Validation**: Validate at both application and database level

### Performance Patterns
- **Index Intentionally**: Add indexes based on query patterns
- **Batch Operations**: Minimize database round trips
- **Connection Pooling**: Manage database connections efficiently

### Schema Evolution
- **Backward Compatible**: Design migrations that don't break existing code
- **Rollback Strategy**: Always have a way to undo changes
- **Test Migrations**: Validate schema changes before production
